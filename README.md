## DB Design
  - Airplane Table
  - Flight
  - Airport
  - City 
  - A flight belongs to an airplane but one airplane can be used in multiple flights
  - A city has many airports but one airport belongs to a city
  - One airport can have many flights, but a flight belongs to one airport

## Tables

### City -> id, name, created_at, updated_at
### Airport -> id, name, address, city_id, created_at, updated_at
### Relationship -> City has many airports  and Airport belongs to one city (one to many)

```

## Model Generation Code Sequelize
```
    npx sequelize model:generate --name Airport --attributes name:String,address:String,cityId:integer
```
